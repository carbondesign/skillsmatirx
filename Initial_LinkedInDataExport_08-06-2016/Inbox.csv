I am reaching out to you to connect with software engineering talent in the DC area. I believe one of my colleagues reached out in the past few months, but wanted to follow up just in case you missed it.  Your profile looked like a match for our core UI development team, to work on building out a refreshed and renewed UI platform. We're pretty language agnostic, so long as you have an interest in React, Angular or NodeJS, creating highly-scalable designs, and working in a progressive, devops culture (CI/CD, Docker, Chef), you could be a fit. 

I'm with a cloud, SaaS provider called Cvent Inc. headquartered in McLean, VA that creates web and mobile software for the event planning and tradeshow space. We also have offices in Austin TX, LA, Portland, OR, Canada, the UK, and India. We're currently 2,000 employees strong and poised to grow another 20-25% in 2016 alone.

We've got some new challenges in our growth as we continue to expand our platform, and your experience could definitely be valuable. Here's a link to the description: https://cvent.csod.com/ats/careersite/JobDetails.aspx?id=1740

The position is a critical one leading a small team in a rebuild of one of our major products.  It just opened up, but we're definitely motivated to start the interview process and get the position filled with the right person.  If you are interested in hearing some more details, let me know and I would be glad to drop you an additional note. If not for you due to timing or whatever reason and you know of anyone else in your network who could be interested, please pass my contact info along. 

I hope to connect with you and looking forward to hearing back.

Sorry to bother you but you looked like a talented developer with some front end skills and I wanted to reach out.  We're expanding across the board, but are particularly looking for someone who has aptitude and passion for UI, and wouldn't mind building cutting edge interfaces with ReactJS.

Cvent, Inc. (www.cvent.com) is the world’s leading provider of cloud-based software for meetings and event management. Since our founding in 1999 we’ve put 7 active products on the market, with more in the pipeline.  We are a unique combination of growth and stability that is unparalleled in a profitable tech company.

As we’re technology agnostic, we’re not looking for a specialist in any particular technology.  We want coders, who are unafraid of switching stacks.  Our tech includes a little bit of almost everything.  Proprietary to Open Source, relational to nosql databases.  Generally, UI consists of either Angular or ReactJS, but there’s diversity there as well.  In any case…

...even if you're not looking until 2017, I'd love to chat and make the introduction in advance of an active job search.  Of course referrals are welcome too.

Will you have time in the coming days/weeks to chat with me for 15 minutes or so?

Andrew Hartford,Leigh Boone,19/03/2016 01:43:25 UTC,Alkemy AngularJS developer opportunity,"Hey Leigh, 

Thanks for connecting. 

To supplement that initial message: our 30-person team at Alkemy (building infrastructure for the IoE) is looking for an ambitious, multi-talented, and experienced AngularJS developer to join our current development team.

We are launching our first product in about 1 month and are currently in the capital raising process (in addition to two SBIR Grants pending with the DHS and NSF). 

Everyone is currently compensated solely on Wealthfront equity rates (since we are pre-launch + prior to the round), with many folks having this on the side doing a 8-12hr. /week + the development team meeting on google hangouts Monday nights. Thus, moonlighting is definitely an option, as many of our team is in that arrangement. 

More in depth would come from our Product Manager in our interview process, but please let me know if you think this is a good fit (skills, structure, etc.) so we don't waste each others time. If you have interest in this, please shoot an email over with your time availabilities for the next 7 days and a good phone number for contact to Vishesh@Alkemy.io + Andrew.d.hartford@gmail.com + jake@alkemy.io. We try to move pretty quickly on our end, so I'd love to get you scheduled soon to elaborate further.

Look forward to the prospect of speaking.

Tayo Oredola,Leigh Boone,11/03/2016 04:49:36 UTC,Hello...,"Hi Leigh,

How's your day going? Thanks for accepting my networking request. 

I realized that I barely know any female frontend developers and usually I'm either the only one or one of two female developers in any team I work with. So I'm hoping to expand my network and interact with other like-minded ladies :-)

I created a group for female developers on Facebook to help support each other and possibly mentor those that want to get into the profession but don't know how to. Female coders are in the minority and there are not many networking opportunities for us to share knowledge and learn from each other. I searched high and low and realized there was no group for female developers/coders on Facebook. I am hoping this will be a platform for us to network and learn from each other, discuss the unique challenges we face and even help with coding challenges as well.
https://www.facebook.com/groups/allFemaleCoders/ 

If you are interested, it will be great to join and invite your friends, but if not, I'm still glad for the opportunity to network with you on LinkedIn. 

 Have a good night!

Preeti Sharma,Leigh Boone,05/01/2016 23:03:04 UTC,RE: technology agnostic software development at CVENT,"Hi Leigh, 

Happy New Year!  I stumbled across your profile in search for an Architect position, but the reality is that we’re expanding across the board to keep up with our revenue growth.  We have a need for everything from Junior developers to leadership and I’d love to chat if you’re even MILDLY curious (i.e. you don’t have to be looking).  

I’m an INTERNAL recruiter (i.e. not an agency), working to continue Cvent expansion in HQ (Northern VA).  We’re a technology agnostic software company with 9 products on the market and more in development.
We’re looking for everything from Principal/Architect on down to Junior developers, with multiple slots open currently.  Hands-on leaders (aka player-coaches) are the strongest need.

We’re pushing more towards the cloud, single page web apps, and open source, so common tools include Nodejs, ReactJS, Java and noSQL databases like Couchbase and ElasticSearch, etc.  However, when .Net and SQL Server are the best way to get things done we use those too.  It’s literally easier to name tech that we DON’T use, which helps us be innovative and has helped us create the best development team in the Mid-Atlantic.  

As a SaaS company, our clients are Fortune 1000, household names like American Express and John Deere, making this an opportunity to work on highly visible, large-scale software products.

If you have time, I invite you to check us out at:

http://www.cvent.com

And even if you're not looking until 2017, I'd love to set up a chat and make the introduction in advance of an active job search.  Of course referrals are welcome too.

Will you have time in the coming days/weeks to chat with a team member for 15 minutes or so?

 Warm Regards,
Preeti Sharma

To supplement that initial message: our 20-person team at Alkemy is looking for an ambitious, multi-talented, and experienced individual to work with our current web dev team to round out implementation of our 1.0 front-end features (built on Angular.js) in anticipation of our October launch of our first product (Optics) and our funding round. Likewise, we have a 4-person UI/UX team looking to help push the needle with the with subsequent tranches of new features (1.1,.2, etc) post launch.

Everyone is currently compensated solely on Wealthfront equity rates (since we are pre-launch + prior to the round), with several folks having this on the side doing a 8-12hr. /week + the team wide tech meeting on google hangouts Monday nights. Thus, moonlighting is definitely an option, as many of our team is in that arrangement. More in depth would come from our Product Manager in our interview process, but please let me know if you think this is a good fit so we don't waste each others time via either tech, arrangement, time, etc.

If you have interest in this, please shoot an email over with your availability the next 7 days to Andrew@HartfordLab.com + Vishesh@Alkemy.io. We try to move pretty quickly on our end, so I'd love to get you scheduled soon to elaborate further.

Look forward to the prospect of speaking.

Best,

Sebastien Theodore,Leigh Boone,25/09/2015 14:37:45 UTC,Sebastien from The DarkStar Group Trying to Reach You,"Dear Leigh, 

I’m the technical recruiter at The DarkStar Group. I emailed previously, but thought I’d send you one more message to explain why I think it makes sense for us to chat. 

Like most companies in the IC/DoD space, we have access to several enterprise software engineering and integration programs doing interesting work with multiple customers. Unless you happen to be with a company doing sole-source work or in-house product development, you will most likely find yourself supporting an IC or DoD customer as a member of a team composed of several companies. In this scenario, where many companies can provide access to the same positions, I think it makes sense for you to ensure you’re working with the one that pays the best, provides opportunities for growth, and values you as a professional and a person. 

This is where DarkStar excels. Every part of our company’s structure is focused on ensuring our engineers have access to meaningful work, a great work/life balance, supportive management, and a superior compensation package. 

To that end, we offer: 

• Better salaries than our competitors – our engineers typically receive pay increases of 15%-25%+ upon joining DarkStar
• A generous benefits package
• No unnecessary bureaucracy or administrative burdens
• Personal back office support
• The stability of a growing company with access to several enterprise programs
• Training and career development
• A management team that wants you to stay focused on technology and your customer, not distracted or overburdened by unrelated requests for support to outside projects and issues

Even if you are very happy in your current situation, scheduling a quick chat with me could tell you if there may be a chance for you to find an even better opportunity. 

Let me know if you’re interested in scheduling a brief initial call.

Thank you,

2. A technical services company that specializes in custom application development while working with the latest Microsoft technologies has an open job for a UI Architect to join the team. This is primarily a remote position.The tech stack (besides .NET/C#/SQL/WebAPIs on the back end) is native JavaScript, Angular and Knockout.

Hope you are doing well. I am really impressed with your front end skills and wanted to connect with you about a long term Sr Interactive Developer contract position, with our client, a prestigious marketing and advertising agency in Arlington, VA.

As a Sr Interactive Developer you will be a key participant in designing architecture for re-build of a global hotel chain.

The role will require strong demonstrable skills in standard web tech (HTML5, CSS3, JS) with experience using MV(X) (Backbone/ember/ angular) and templating (handlebars, mustache) frameworks and library. Understanding and usage of all responsive design techniques a must. Experience with Node.js and dev ops tools like grunt/gulp a plus. You will analyze existing dotcom JS/ CSS code base and ensure it fits and performs similar functionality when re-architected in the new platform.

John Yan,Leigh Boone,01/05/2015 15:57:55 UTC,RE: you sent me a message,"
Hi Leigh,

Yes, I'm looking for a graphic/UI/UX designer to redesign/design our logo, App, website, product package and marketing materials. We're a food and technology startup based in Union Kitchen and 1776. We're chef, Android/Java developers and marketer. But we need a new designer now. 

Actually, we also need a Android developer to share some workload with our current Android developer. So your background looks very interesting.

We can meet for one hour today after 4pm or anytime tomorrow/Saturday if you are available. Convenient places for me are Georgetown, GWU's new building(22nd St NW and H St NW) or Rosslyn. But I can go anywhere as long as it's close to a metro station. Please let me know the best date, time and place for you. Look forward to meeting you!

Thanks,
John

I hope all is well. Are you open to full time work with a local small business at this point in time if the opportunity is right? The most immediate openings I have are with a Cyber Security focused organization that is looking to find strong Front-End Developers. They have needs in both their products and services departments, so depending on your preference, the details of the positions will vary. The technology stack will somewhat vary as well but the core areas are with Python/Django/JavaScript, particularly frameworks such as Angular, Backbone and Ember. The one thing that will not vary, in any of the openings, is that you would be working with cutting edge Security Intelligence & Analytics Software.

Wesley Cho,Leigh Boone,21/08/2014 06:58:43 UTC,RE: Congrats!,"That sucks about the work environment, it sounded like your dream position otherwise.  The people you work with might be the most important aspect in a workplace, so bad politics does not make for a good place to be in.

Funny story about FINRA - a recruiter basically begged me to talk with him about a lead developer position there back around January/February, but then said it probably wasn't worth going forward with interviewing because of the # of years of experience I had.  I know they were considering using Angular around then, but weren't decided - did they decide to go with it?

I left Captora since it was pretty much being run like a dev sweatshop, with 60 hour weeks being expected.  I got a pretty nasty email of criticisms questioning my work ethic and holding having to take time off due to military obligations against me, as well as blaming me for taking 4 weeks to do a project instead of 2 due to requirements changing on me near daily.

My new company seems so much better so far, similar to Learning Objects in a lot of ways but more diverse than most tech companies...and have unlimited vacation!  It's a joy working here in a more sane environment.

If you're looking for a job in the future & are open to relocating to the San Francisco Bay area, my company would definitely consider you - we're in downtown Palo Alto and about to rapidly expand since we're about to close on our Series B round of fundraising.  A plus is that we work on supped up Macbook Pros (the 17"" ones) & an Apple monitor :) . /endobligatoryhiringcomment

I'm willing to give a talk on Jan. 20th, 2015 btw - I'll actually be in DC around then for an annual event, so it'd be perfect for catching up with everyone in the DC Angular community.

Anyhow, thought I'd check in since I had the job hopping experience recently - glad to hear things are going well for you, and I hope it continues rolling on!

I am using it now for a project that is in progress. i'll let you know how it goes. 

Here's a great diagram that shows the overlap with Angular (and how to link up the data binding). 

As a front end developer, I have been using Angular for the properties in the Green and Orange you see in the digram. Red is good but I have never really been that good at that part. The Yellow in the polymer section opens up a whole new world of speed and reusability for front-end dev.

http://blog.sethladd.com/2014/02/angular-and-polymer-data-binding.html

Also here are some things I have noticed and am excited about:

* polyfills are baked in so less stress for cross browser support
* you can scope the CSS...brilliant! This has been in the back of my mind for awhile
* it addresses layout so no need for bootstrap or angular-strap
* there are more out-of-the box components already built with beautiful animations
* It's like Angular meets bootstrap but WAY better
* other UI/CSS3 features like flexbox are easier and built in
* building widgets/reusable components and registering them is MUCH cleaner 
* it works with angular so no wasted code 
* the style binding replaces the need for some elements of LESS/SASS
* I think their designer tool is a GREAT way to prototype with reusable code...the holy grail!

Hey Courtney. 

There is going to be a fact-finding interview by the Deputy of the Virginia Employment Commission on August 8 at 1pm via phone. You may have already received a notice for it. At any rate, Tory (or you?) is claiming I was fired for misconduct rather than ""cultural differences"" which is what I was told. Though Tory and I had disagreements, I am unaware of being cited for misconduct. I was hoping you could either provide me with documentation or testify via phone to the timeline of events and to the content that was covered in any of our meetings.

Let me know.

Thanks again for all you help.

Great speaking with you today regarding the FINRA Senior UI Engineer. I 
spoke with Grant and I had the timing wrong for a conversation with him. 
Can you speak at 2:30? As soon as I receive them, I will send him your 
portfolio/links of your work and your resume so that he will be prepared. 
Grant and I are really excited to hear that you’re interested in the 
position. Assuming things go well with your conversation with Grant and you 
are still interested, we would like to submit you to FINRA today. I know 
you have a bunch of things going on and don’t want either group to miss out 
on a great opportunity/match for you. I have included the link of the 
official job description for your review.

 

PS—not sure if you know them from 5AM Solutions, but we placed Max 
Shestopalov and more recently, Marwan Oweis at FINRA. Maybe you know them!

I came across your name in the Maryland.JS MeetUp Group and wanted to follow up with you. I'm working on a Sr. U.I. Engineer with a client in Rockville MD, with your demonstrated interest and LinkedIn title it looks like your background matches well with the role I'm working on. This position is going to be full-time permanent and is a combination of heavy front end development (javascript and its various libraries) and making significant contributions to the UI design. 

They're one of the most sought after companies in the area--I think they can make it worth your while, at least for a conversation... Any interest?

I am using it now for a project that is in progress. i'll let you know how it goes. 

Here's a great diagram that shows the overlap with Angular (and how to link up the data binding). 

As a front end developer, I have been using Angular for the properties in the Green and Orange you see in the digram. Red is good but I have never really been that good at that part. The Yellow in the polymer section opens up a whole new world of speed and reusability for front-end dev.

http://blog.sethladd.com/2014/02/angular-and-polymer-data-binding.html

Also here are some things I have noticed and am excited about:

* polyfills are baked in so less stress for cross browser support
* you can scope the CSS...brilliant! This has been in the back of my mind for awhile
* it addresses layout so no need for bootstrap or angular-strap
* there are more out-of-the box components already built with beautiful animations
* It's like Angular meets bootstrap but WAY better
* other UI/CSS3 features like flexbox are easier and built in
* building widgets/reusable components and registering them is MUCH cleaner 
* it works with angular so no wasted code 
* the style binding replaces the need for some elements of LESS/SASS
* I think their designer tool is a GREAT way to prototype with reusable code...the holy grail!

Hey Andy, 

I worked on a more formal document (google doc link below) this weekend so that you could take a look in advance. I realized this is a lot to get into when we meet.

I am really excited about your thoughts on this. To be honest, I had totally forgot about your background in recruiting/careerbuilder/job boards. Like I said earlier, I think someone needs to build this damn thing. I don't have the resources, industry knowledge, or time. If you liked it and thought it would work, I would love to hand this baby off to you (for some sort of TBD equity or something) because I think with your background you could blow this up. Also, I think this idea is in complete alignment with StartMonday.co statement: ""We just killed the CV...""

And..because FriendDA.org cracks me up and I use it whenever I can...by clicking on this link:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqPjkSMuOSLlDQ2ZKxqySZU5e753xmFFcwGk2x3SdTY/edit?usp=sharing

you Andy Evans agree to:

FRIENDDA AGREEMENT

This agreement is entered into this 8th day of June 2014 by and between Andy Evans (hereinafter ""The Advisor"") and Leigh Boone (hereinafter ""The Keeper of the Idea"" or ""I"") regarding information The Keeper of The Idea is choosing to share with The Advisor (hereinafter ""The Idea"").

WHEREAS I possess a bright idea that I am choosing to disclose to you, The Advisor, with the mutual understanding that you are my friend and that you will not screw me.

Manners of screwing include, but are not limited to:
• Adapting some or all of The Idea for your own purposes.
• Choosing to share some or all of The Idea with those who are not bound to this agreement.
• Failing to do your best to protect The Idea.

This is a ""warm blanket"" agreement with which, by requesting your agreement to it, I am helping myself sleep at night by placing a small amount of formality on the sharing of The Idea. I believe The Idea will only improve as a result of having solicited your honest and clear feedback.

TERM

The term of this agreement shall continue until The Idea is no longer confidential.

BREACH

This agreement has absolutely no legal binding. However, upon breach or violation of the agreement, I will feel free to do any of the following:
• Curse you under my breath.
• Publicly disclose the manner of your screw-i-tude.
• Write about your transgressions in ALL CAPS.
• No longer consider you a person with whom I can share my ideas.
Sharing

Sharing of some or all of The Idea with third parties may occur provided that you have cleared this with me and the third parties agree to the principles of the FriendDA.

TERMINATION

Termination of this FriendDA can be executed by either party, but don't be a douche.

You are acknowledging and agreeing to this disclosure by reading it. If you find any part of this agreement uncomfortable or confusing, don't sweat it. We'll talk about something else.

But during all that my recruiter and I really hit it off and started talking about an idea he had that tapped into my background with CareerBuilder.  So I pretty much dropped everything and went for it.  It's a mobile recruiting app on Android, iOS and web.  We've now got 9 people working on it and we're actively pitching for funding.  The guys in Berlin are powerhouse sales dudes and we've already got Hilton, Vodaphone, H&M, McDonalds, L'Oreal, and like 15 other big brands signed up.  I've been writing code - I did the whole first version of our iOS app, the most code I've written in like 10 years :)  We're looking at beta in Prague at the end of the summer now (Prague because it's really hip in Europe at the moment, and a small manageable market for a test).  I just got back from a couple of weeks over there and heading back on the 15th.

Just finished a kitchen renovation ourselves - not the greatest timing for me, but we survived :)  

Have you thought about open-sourcing the usability tool?  That way you could leverage the community to develop it - given the steep prices of tools like Usabilla these days, I think it would get some support from the community.

Hi Leigh, 

I'm glad I caught your attention. I'm not a recruiter.  I'm just a guy looking to build an awesome team of thinkers and builders and I'm thinking you might fit the bill. 

Please take a moment to check out the position but if you've got 15 mins. I can do the position a bit more justice than the job description alone.  I'm free tomorrow morning between 11am and 1pm. Can we connect then? My number is 703-854-4495

Best, 

Tory.

Hi Leigh, 

I’m Tory Hargro, visual design manager at USA TODAY. I was just looking at your background and am very impressed. Nice Work!

I'm reaching out to you because I’m building a new interactive storytelling team at USA TODAY in Tyson’s Corner, VA and if you’ve ever thought about yourself as a storyteller then I think you might be a good fit for the team.   

I’m looking for someone who get’s excited about using design to communicate ideas and information about national conversations (sports, politics, healthcare, tech). From a skills prospective I’m looking for a master UX designer with strong UI prototyping skills. 

I’m hoping we might build a UX/UI or Product designer role just for you. If you want to learn more then check out the link below and hit reply.
 
I hope this message finds you well and doing work that you enjoy.

I think this is a great topic, but maybe a little out of my wheelhouse. Will is our Chief Science Officer, but he is also incredibly tech and UX/Design savvy and an all around good guy.

We have made a lot of progress but the industry has a long way to go. Meaningful Use/Obamacare will jumpstart it in the next two years. 

If you're looking for blog ideas you might want to check out FHIR http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/ . Let me give you some history. FHIR is being developed by the HL7 community. The specs were donated by someone from Australia and are completely open. HL7 has a long history of developing standards for interoperability. HL7 V1 and V2 specs were/are pipe delimited and are still the primary means of data communication. V3 came out a few years ago and nobody adopted it because it wasn't stringent enough. They started looking at FHIR about a year ago and it has a lot of interest. Enough history.

Here's the rub. There's a battle (or at least there should be) between specifications for parsing, storing and mining data and specifications to support UI. In a sense it's a battle between Dr.s that are researchers and those that practice. Mayo Clinic's three shields stand for practice, research and education so I work with both sides. If I had to pick a side I would be on the practice side. But like any good physician I know that you can't have practice without research. One of the HL7 board members is on my team. I'm not confident that he grasped my suggestion to get buy-in from the UX community before putting the stamp of approval on the specs. If I were a blogger with UX connections I would get them on this. I'm not a blogger and I just don't do that kind of thing. HL7 V2 is outdated. V3 failed fast. Someone should slap the old schoolers up side the head and move them into this century.

I'm glad to hear a submarine earthquake of opportunity is soaking the shores of your career.  I didn't know you had tried striking out on your own before, but glad to hear that it's going well.  The idea of working for myself is one I've toyed with, but to be honest I don't think I'll ever have the courage for it.  So, it's always inspiring to hear of friends who are giving it ago.

I glanced at your profile page before messaging you* and you really do have a unique blend of skills.  So, I'm not surprised by the opportunities you're getting.

BTW -- I really do appreciate you emailing me to say farewell.  Leaving a job is tough, and I wasn't sure if you'd want to keep in touch or have a clean break.  But I mean what I said before: next time your in my neck of the woods give a shout, and we'll grab a beer.

Darrell Gaspar,Leigh Boone,10/06/2013 18:49:10 UTC,RE: one more email about the salary history feature....,"Hey Leigh,

Sorry it took so long for me to reply! No, I hadn't heard you had left LO before you told. I'm sorry that it didn't work out. Can you tell me why exactly you left?

I do like the idea of a salary tracker. I knew Glassdoor had that data but I didn't realize Indeed had it as well. I'm not sure what data Linkedin has as (I don't think) we ask our users to self-report their salaries. If we do have that data somewhere, it must be reported by the employers themselves. 

I think it would be a useful tool, for employers to know what they could reasonably offer someone moving from one position to another and for applicants to know what they could reasonably expect.

Unfortunately, I don't think Linkedin hires contractors for technical work like this. The best I can do is recommend you for a web developer position here. I know you can roll with HTML and CSS but how comfortable do you feel with Javascript? Also the position would require relocation to California.

Good luck on your search!

one last thing....and the point of that salary history feature. I like that it is the industry average and not my actual salary. When I'm looking for a job I can be confident in my worth and, in my case, I can show progression. I hate talking about money with potential employers. They might say I am asking for too much and here I have supporting evidence. It could even help me articulate why I might be above that range. Or, if I were below—and that graph is shockingly accurate—it might help me argue why I deserved more, especially if it were linked to job descriptions and I could show I was doing more. Maybe there is even a feature for ""actual salary,"" that lists those arguments or points on the graph. 

Additionally, in situations where I am working at as a software instructor where the pay is based on the demand and the demand fluctuates, I can more accurately talk about my value as is it relates to an annual salary. As an instructor there is peak demands throughout the year, shockingly well illustrated by that graph. To say I made X amount annually as an instructor is misleading. Four to five months of that year I was not teaching a lot. With that graph I can say, ""during peak times I was making X amount per month which translates into and annual salary of Y.""

Ok, back to work. These resumes are not going to send themselves. :)

Take care.

Also since you, Mike, and me (and I emailed Jane) are sometimes direct competitors, I don't want to take any work away from you guys. And speaking of...I hear Mike sometimes works for FMC. Tom Wilson was the first person to give me a job as a trainer all those years ago, back when I met you and Mike at that InDesign Users Group meeting...And I love Tom but he is a cheap bastard, which makes him a good facility manager. At any rate, he has used me occasionally because he doesn't want to pay more for other instructors, even if I am much less qualified. I don't like accidentally undercutting my coworkers and typically there is enough work for us all. 

So...I am teaching an ePub class for him on the 27th. He is paying me $400/day and he has ALWAYS paid the least of all the facilities. I don't particularly care to negotiate with him because he is WAY better at negotiating than I am. He is also offering me potential work for the Adobe Cloud stuff, but I saw the ""I can get her cheaper and she doesn't know it"" look he has so I am sure there someone else out there he is talking to....maybe you guys?

I actually haven't changed my name to Boone officially yet. Will work on it next week. Otis and I have been separated now for as long as we were married, so I REALLY need to finish the paperwork on my divorce. I didn't want to start this new freelance venture as Leigh Frampton so I unofficially changed it on Thursday.

I didn't get married again...obviously as that would be bigamy. I decided to take the last name of my best friends mother. She was my guardian in high school for awhile. She was a teacher, technophile, and all around adventurous lady. She was the first person to put a software training video in my hand, a video for Flash. I decided it was a fitting name for the new me. Also, my friends children who I adore and treat as if they are my own both have the middle name Boone, so taking the name was a good way to bring my two families together. And if I ever do get married again, I doubt I will take his name. Too much paper work and it seems to be a bit of an outdated tradition.

Obviously for CP the problems are totally different; lack of attention, lack of thought, lack of direction, lack of dev time, lack of decision-making. And yet the same: when there is any attention its knee jerk and needing data to make a decision that never happens.

There is a lot of b.s and promising of stuff that never happens. Alli has been good to push things along for every part of LO but CP. I have to leave for my own sanity, I just haven't found the right thing yet. I'm working on it though.

The problem is when, each time, I think five projects now, there is either crucial (obvious) information to the project that he has missed (H-M) or neglects to give me (carnegie) or gives me last minute (carnegie, Sage, IMS) or that I point out information in the beginning, he blows it off, and then it comes back and we have to deal with it and changes after months of work (EiQ/UMT). I'm not saying I have all the answers or that I'm inflexible. I'm just saying this shit is preventable and the number one way for it to get fixed is for Derek to sit back and be a CEO and not the direct link to the client or acting product manager who only have five minutes to spend thinking about any of this. He needs to take himself out of the process or limit his exposure to them. And I know this whole Difference Engine thing is just getting started and that he is excited and we are short staffed, but he can't keep doing this. He is 10 conversations behind myself and the client and yet he wants to start every meeting by leading the direction instead of sitting back and hearing where things are. Even worse, while infront of the client he has reacted as if this is the first time he's seen our work and then precedes to throw us under the bus, I guess in order to save face, but while losing the loyalty of his employees...and it's not just me.

But the breaking point was to have him come to me to say I am not communicating (IMS and UMT/EiQ)...which is ironically hysterical, or that I can't take input (on everything). I can. I'm not hard to work with, but I am experienced at what I do and am going to advise on the best approach for the type of work I've done for 15 years. When I ask for clarity or details from him, the tools of my trade, the material I need to do my job, he shifts around and squirms...because he does not have the time to think these things through, and yet he continues to direct with authority. Which is what lead to my comment that he ""does not know what he is talking about."" Not as a CEO. I wouldn't know about that. I have not seen him work much as a CEO. I am speaking specifically of his role as a product manager and a direct link to the client and a micro-manager of how I do my job and as someone who doesn't have the type of time to dedicate to pulling these projects together.

After all, call me crazy, but the CEO of a company shouldn't be spending his time directing me on how to make a PNG with a script. As an Adobe Certified Instructor in Photoshop and three other products, I know how to make thumbnails with a fucking script. And yet, while I'm doing such a task, he is IMing my boss who is stretched thin and asking him to do the same work.

On top of it all Alli think the answer is for me to change how I do my job, how I and other creative workers have done their work for years, to something she learned at ""DeLoitte and Douchebag."" I told her as a creative, my job is to take all the pieces—pieces that Derek prevents me from getting (just Derek. I've worked with Alli, Jon Mott, Craig, Jeremy, and Brian and they give me the details I need)—and distill them down and work with them until I get the picture. Her advice is to, in order to work with Derek, I need to think first of the big picture and then do the details. That's great for business I guess, and that type of process sure as hell lead to an ass-backwards SOW for H-M recently that, between Alli and I working together, turned into a success. However, if I could turn the creative process upside down and start by giving some one the 3 minute anser to the unsolved riddle, I'd be fucking rich. 

At any rate, I'm really glad you emailed. I've been distracted with other things and it has been good to write down what the hell happened. I don't think—I know actually—Derek has no idea what happened. I know Alli understands some of this, but I think I'm going to share this info with her. Alli and I have rarely seen eye to eye, but then we have our moments of clarity and I am surprised. And it's not like they can fire me for saying it and, who knows, maybe some change will come of it.  The sad truth is that I honestly believe in that company. The people they have there are AWESOME. Really. And I think once they settle themselves it will be good, as long as Derek can stop stepping on his dick long enough to get out his talented staff's way. I don't wish him ill will. I just wish him clarity.

I would appreciate any leads you can send my way. I do have to be careful of the ed tech field though. Because I was doing so much BD, I am probably in danger of violating my NDA if I try to do anything in edTech. 

But not to worry. I'm good at this part. I've already had a lot of conversations this week and my door get's beaten down daily by recruiters. My rare combination of design, software instructor and developer makes me very marketable....and I know I am in a much better position than I left my coworkers in. I'm even taking some time off to get to some personal coding projects I have wanted to do for a few months now.

Well, that message certainly got long. I hope all is well with you. Keep in touch.

How's the gig going?  I started a new job in January so not at Echo anymore - I'm working in Reston for a cyber security company with a bunch of people I worked with before at AOL. I'm liking it a lot.

Good luck finding someone - hope things are going good otherwise!
Take care,
Nancy

--------------------
So hi again.

Things have been crazy at work and I was sitting at my desk updating my resume and thought, ""hmmm, maybe I'll ask John. He's the one that got me into this in the first place.""

First of all, thank you for getting me into this. Your love of technology was infectious and I really was paying attention all those drunk, smokey nights of endless chatter in dark bars. (was also fondly remembering where I saw my first ipod and how I told you I didn't get it...but you let me listen to it anyway) It's been a long road away from print design but I couldn't be happier (present situation excluded). I'm working now as a pseudo-UI developer/web designer (and Jill of all trades) and hope to head toward being an Information Architect one day (a friend and mentor just turned me on to the title a few days ago).

Just so you know how far I've come, you can see my handy work at www.grabnetworks.com. I built the whole thing using Django. As there is only me working on it, some things are still in draft form. One thing I'm pretty proud of is the Video Catalog tab on the footer. It still needs some work but I wrote about 85% of the code on my own.

Gratitude aside...things at Grab are a mess. They let their VP of engineering go, stopped looking for a replacement, and then replaced him with someone from the business and sales side with disastrous results. Now it's down to a handful of people. They're back to looking for a VP of E (I think when we were talking a few months ago it was a CTO but they've changed their mind ). Know anyone who's crazy enough to save a sinking ship? I ask because the business/sales leads have proven over and over again they can't hire an engineer if their company depended on it, and it does. And the Systems Architect, who is fantastic, is a master pacifist and won't fight them. I know I seem rather low on the totem pole to be asking this, but it's kind of a small company and I'm loud...which is rarely a good thing. 

Truth be told, I'm not sure this company is worth saving. I'm not sure they have the right formula to sustain their recent 'hokey stick' jump in revenue (aka the sales guys finally figured out how not to suck at their jobs and finally met their goal this quarter). But I kind of like my commute, and I don't think this is too hard to fix if there were someone in place who ""knew what the they were doing"" (their words, not mine), and someone who was crazy enough to fix a disaster.

Anyway, I gave it a shot. Back to working on my portfolio.

Hope all is well with you.

Best wishes.

Hi Leigh,

Since you’re located in the DC area it only makes sense to talk about this specific organization and opportunity...

One of the most prestigious companies that I work with is looking for Senior UI Engineers to come in and work on “ground up”, new development. This person will quickly become an expert in the realm of Javascript and AngularJS. 

Here’s the caveat. This company is literally impossible to get a job at. They poach from Google and Amazon and vice versa. They look for big time problem solvers, people who can think outside the box, and want to be surrounded by some of the best Engineers in the DC area. 

Honestly, I don’t have a shortage of interested candidates; I have a shortage of qualified individuals. With that said, I know your educational background and LinkedIn profile is definitely up their alley. 

Let’s get on the phone and see if there are any synergies. If not, no big deal, I'd love to stay in touch as your local market resource if you are ever curious as to what is on the market. :-)

""Project management seems to come naturally to Shrini and  was always my go-to  resource for what was happening in the project; processes and procedures for moving the project forward; and approaches to coding problems. He was always there for guidance but still seemed to manage a very heavy workload. Working with Shrini has been both a pleasure and an education. 

Some of my favorite Shrini moments have been:
* He voluntarily reviewed my code and gave very constructive and clear feedback that made me a better developer
* He gave great advice on how to best navigate conflicting requirements
* He helped get the teams code checked in on a regular schedule…and  kept it on schedule
* He swiftly resolved many issues with a jQuery plugin, including resolving name spacing conflicts, and advised on how best to work with the client
* He did a lot to get my computer working within the systems inside FINRA
* Any time I’ve asked Shrini about a ticket, he can name several other related JIRA tickets, who has them, and what state they are in (I swear he has the JIRA board memorized)
* He has always been proactive and forthcoming about project communications, while maintaining an incredibly calm, clear demeanor

Given the chance, I would have gladly worked with Shrini as a Team Lead or or Project Manager.

I just saw the ""3 year anniversary"" note from LinkedIn. Funny thing, 1.) I was just thinking about that week you left as it was also the week I met Mark an we are just celebrating out 3 year anniversary, and 2.) I just put my resume in at Perfect Sense Digital. 

I have been doing a lot more front end dev and rapid prototyping with HTML/CSS/Angular. I got into it a little over a year ago and started the Angular Meeup Group. I kind of got hooked on MVC once Alan helped me with the Video Library. I have also been doing more UX stuff but I'd rather do more dev in a company that has designers. 

At any rate, a recruiter contacted me this week and submitted my resume to PSD. It looks like a great company to work for. I like their CMS. It looks clean. 

So, if you don't mind, I have a few questions for you. 

• Is it a good place to work? 

• Do they use Angular or similar? 

• It looks like their CMS is Java. I must admit that is not my strong suit. How much, how often do the front end dev work with the Java code?

Hope all is well with you.

Hi Leigh -

We never were introduced, but I got to see some of your work and posts when you were at 5AM.  Yesterday, I learned you had left and Leslie Power sent me your LInkedIn link.  Despite 5AM's loss, it looks like you have found great home that will exploit your hybrid skills.

Wishing you great success,

Leigh Boone,Andrew Evans,08/06/2014 17:34:58 UTC,RE: Hi!,"Hey Andy, 

I worked on a more formal document (google doc link below) this weekend so that you could take a look in advance. I realized this is a lot to get into when we meet.

I am really excited about your thoughts on this. To be honest, I had totally forgot about your background in recruiting/careerbuilder/job boards. Like I said earlier, I think someone needs to build this damn thing. I don't have the resources, industry knowledge, or time. If you liked it and thought it would work, I would love to hand this baby off to you (for some sort of TBD equity or something) because I think with your background you could blow this up. Also, I think this idea is in complete alignment with StartMonday.co statement: ""We just killed the CV...""

And..because FriendDA.org cracks me up and I use it whenever I can...by clicking on this link:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqPjkSMuOSLlDQ2ZKxqySZU5e753xmFFcwGk2x3SdTY/edit?usp=sharing

you Andy Evans agree to:

FRIENDDA AGREEMENT

This agreement is entered into this 8th day of June 2014 by and between Andy Evans (hereinafter ""The Advisor"") and Leigh Boone (hereinafter ""The Keeper of the Idea"" or ""I"") regarding information The Keeper of The Idea is choosing to share with The Advisor (hereinafter ""The Idea"").

WHEREAS I possess a bright idea that I am choosing to disclose to you, The Advisor, with the mutual understanding that you are my friend and that you will not screw me.

Manners of screwing include, but are not limited to:
• Adapting some or all of The Idea for your own purposes.
• Choosing to share some or all of The Idea with those who are not bound to this agreement.
• Failing to do your best to protect The Idea.

This is a ""warm blanket"" agreement with which, by requesting your agreement to it, I am helping myself sleep at night by placing a small amount of formality on the sharing of The Idea. I believe The Idea will only improve as a result of having solicited your honest and clear feedback.

TERM

The term of this agreement shall continue until The Idea is no longer confidential.

BREACH

This agreement has absolutely no legal binding. However, upon breach or violation of the agreement, I will feel free to do any of the following:
• Curse you under my breath.
• Publicly disclose the manner of your screw-i-tude.
• Write about your transgressions in ALL CAPS.
• No longer consider you a person with whom I can share my ideas.
Sharing

Sharing of some or all of The Idea with third parties may occur provided that you have cleared this with me and the third parties agree to the principles of the FriendDA.

TERMINATION

Termination of this FriendDA can be executed by either party, but don't be a douche.

You are acknowledging and agreeing to this disclosure by reading it. If you find any part of this agreement uncomfortable or confusing, don't sweat it. We'll talk about something else.

I could probably do early in the morning as well. I'm at Tysons Corner, and though you are welcome to come hangout at the Gannette campus, the traffic can be a bit painful. I can jump on metro and meet you at courthouse. 

Be forewarned, every once in awhile ""breaking news"" happens and I have to drop everything and jump on it if they need an interactive, but it is unlikely.

The startup - I had fired up my recruiter network about 3 months before I actually left 5AM, and one of the things I was looking at was a move to Europe.  Kinda just for the hell of it.  So I had a recruiter in Berlin looking for stuff for me, and I actually went a couple of rounds with Ableton, but it kind of fizzled.  But during all that my recruiter and I really hit it off and started talking about an idea he had that tapped into my background with CareerBuilder.  So I pretty much dropped everything and went for it.  It's a mobile recruiting app on Android, iOS and web.  We've now got 9 people working on it and we're actively pitching for funding.  The guys in Berlin are powerhouse sales dudes and we've already got Hilton, Vodaphone, H&M, McDonalds, L'Oreal, and like 15 other big brands signed up.  I've been writing code - I did the whole first version of our iOS app, the most code I've written in like 10 years :)  We're looking at beta in Prague at the end of the summer now (Prague because it's really hip in Europe at the moment, and a small manageable market for a test).  I just got back from a couple of weeks over there and heading back on the 15th.

Just finished a kitchen renovation ourselves - not the greatest timing for me, but we survived :)  

Have you thought about open-sourcing the usability tool?  That way you could leverage the community to develop it - given the steep prices of tools like Usabilla these days, I think it would get some support from the community.

And sadly, no, I didn't get anything done with the Usability. As with most things there, no time/resources were ever allocated to preparation or process. I am thinking about sticking with it though and blogging about  it on my own. I will keep you posted as I work on it.

USA Today is pretty awesome. They have their issues and dirty laundry, but it's much easier to bare. The facilities and resources are amazing and I am getting to work in Angular and the projects are fast moving and very from week to week.

I'll take the blog post I wrote for 5am and put it on a design/usability, called INeedYourBrain.com (as in...I can't design or create a usable product unless I get into your brain). I have been planning to start anyway. That way the ""basic recipe"" is there for anyone to play with. Then I start a repo and see if I can get anyone to help. 

I want to use this sort of thing at USA Today, though it will need to be modified. In general, we are looking to experiment with and find ""other types of metrics"" that we can use. I have the domain ""clicksarenotenough.com"" as a product page.

So, for your recruiting app...do you have any need of the skills matrix/team building profile we talked about? To be honest, I have been working on that for years and have a lot written down, but don't think I will ever get much time to write the code...and it would be really easy to write. It is such a cool idea and everyone I have mention it to has thought it was a great idea, but I just don't have the time right now. If so, let me know. Would be happy to share.

Hi Leigh, 

I’m Tory Hargro, visual design manager at USA TODAY. I was just looking at your background and am very impressed. Nice Work!

I'm reaching out to you because I’m building a new interactive storytelling team at USA TODAY in Tyson’s Corner, VA and if you’ve ever thought about yourself as a storyteller then I think you might be a good fit for the team.   

I’m looking for someone who get’s excited about using design to communicate ideas and information about national conversations (sports, politics, healthcare, tech). From a skills prospective I’m looking for a master UX designer with strong UI prototyping skills.

Well I work about as far from UI as you can get. The past three years I've been setting up infrastructure at Mayo Clinic to exchange medical information with outside medical entities. We have made a lot of progress but the industry has a long way to go. Meaningful Use/Obamacare will jumpstart it in the next two years. 

If you're looking for blog ideas you might want to check out FHIR http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/ . Let me give you some history. FHIR is being developed by the HL7 community. The specs were donated by someone from Australia and are completely open. HL7 has a long history of developing standards for interoperability. HL7 V1 and V2 specs were/are pipe delimited and are still the primary means of data communication. V3 came out a few years ago and nobody adopted it because it wasn't stringent enough. They started looking at FHIR about a year ago and it has a lot of interest. Enough history.

Here's the rub. There's a battle (or at least there should be) between specifications for parsing, storing and mining data and specifications to support UI. In a sense it's a battle between Dr.s that are researchers and those that practice. Mayo Clinic's three shields stand for practice, research and education so I work with both sides. If I had to pick a side I would be on the practice side. But like any good physician I know that you can't have practice without research. One of the HL7 board members is on my team. I'm not confident that he grasped my suggestion to get buy-in from the UX community before putting the stamp of approval on the specs. If I were a blogger with UX connections I would get them on this. I'm not a blogger and I just don't do that kind of thing. HL7 V2 is outdated. V3 failed fast. Someone should slap the old schoolers up side the head and move them into this century.

Right now I am looking at partnering with a design studio I worked for in the past located in DC at Dupont. They are FABULOUS designers: http://www.cuttingedgedc.com/ though they lack experience in digital media and web and app design. The loose plan right now is that I help fill in that gap and help build and develop websites while working with them on the aspects of UI/UX. Also, they will partner with me in providing top notch graphics support on my dev projects.

All of this is to say, I know a fantastic group for even the smallest of design projects, if you or anyone you know is looking for design work. Work preferably outside of the eLearning environment, but am trying to get Derek to define what I can and can't do inside the eLearning environment. (not holding my breath). I am hoping, if I stay away from directly interacting with the client I can do the tech portion of the work.

Take care.

The place I teach mostly is ThinkBig in Columbia — they are also talking about opening an office in DC, and if they do, I can't teach all the classes in both places. Plus we don't totally overlap. Also Sean and Mark Snyder are there.

The second place is with Khaled Hadi at Tysons and Farragut, but not much is running there yet. 

I can give you more details on both and tell Christine and Khaled. Which email address should I use?

Interesting that you didn't go to your maiden name! I kept mine, which made it easy when I divorced. Are the Boones related to Daniel? I ask because a friend of mine with the name *is* related to him.

I actually haven't changed my name to Boone officially yet. Will work on it next week. Otis and I have been separated now for as long as we were married, so I REALLY need to finish the paperwork on my divorce. I didn't want to start this new freelance venture as Leigh Frampton so I unofficially changed it on Thursday.

I didn't get married again...obviously as that would be bigamy. I decided to take the last name of my best friends mother. She was my guardian in high school for awhile. She was a teacher, technophile, and all around adventurous lady. She was the first person to put a software training video in my hand, a video for Flash. I decided it was a fitting name for the new me. Also, my friends children who I adore and treat as if they are my own both have the middle name Boone, so taking the name was a good way to bring my two families together. And if I ever do get married again, I doubt I will take his name. Too much paper work and it seems to be a bit of an outdated tradition.

Also since you, Mike, and me (and I emailed Jane) are sometimes direct competitors, I don't want to take any work away from you guys. And speaking of...I hear Mike sometimes works for FMC. Tom Wilson was the first person to give me a job as a trainer all those years ago, back when I met you and Mike at that InDesign Users Group meeting...And I love Tom but he is a cheap bastard, which makes him a good facility manager. At any rate, he has used me occasionally because he doesn't want to pay more for other instructors, even if I am much less qualified. I don't like accidentally undercutting my coworkers and typically there is enough work for us all. 

So...I am teaching an ePub class for him on the 27th. He is paying me $400/day and he has ALWAYS paid the least of all the facilities. I don't particularly care to negotiate with him because he is WAY better at negotiating than I am. He is also offering me potential work for the Adobe Cloud stuff, but I saw the ""I can get her cheaper and she doesn't know it"" look he has so I am sure there someone else out there he is talking to....maybe you guys?

But the good news is that I have found a TON of freelance design and coding work in just a few short days and which lets me work for myself again for a bit. Telling Derek to fuck off may have been the best and most lucrative thing I have done for my career. 

I didn't know Margaret was leaving. She told me she was thinking about it. Good for her. And I'm glad you are leaving too. I think if Derek had his way, he'd abandon Campus Pack all together. I worry about Hal too.

Take care.

WOW. I had no idea of any of this though I have experienced the exact same things related to Campus Pack and my role. I know others have too.

Obviously for CP the problems are totally different; lack of attention, lack of thought, lack of direction, lack of dev time, lack of decision-making. And yet the same: when there is any attention its knee jerk and needing data to make a decision that never happens.

There is a lot of b.s and promising of stuff that never happens. Alli has been good to push things along for every part of LO but CP. I have to leave for my own sanity, I just haven't found the right thing yet. I'm working on it though. 

Alli is trying to push me out and with Margaret leaving I guess I'm needed for a little while longer, but not much. I really believe in CP and LO, but the product is dying a slow death and we're all going down with it.

Leigh Boone,Darrell Gaspar,03/06/2013 13:16:08 UTC,one more email about the salary history feature....,"one last thing....and the point of that salary history feature. I like that it is the industry average and not my actual salary. When I'm looking for a job I can be confident in my worth and, in my case, I can show progression. I hate talking about money with potential employers. They might say I am asking for too much and here I have supporting evidence. It could even help me articulate why I might be above that range. Or, if I were below—and that graph is shockingly accurate—it might help me argue why I deserved more, especially if it were linked to job descriptions and I could show I was doing more. Maybe there is even a feature for ""actual salary,"" that lists those arguments or points on the graph. 

Additionally, in situations where I am working at as a software instructor where the pay is based on the demand and the demand fluctuates, I can more accurately talk about my value as is it relates to an annual salary. As an instructor there is peak demands throughout the year, shockingly well illustrated by that graph. To say I made X amount annually as an instructor is misleading. Four to five months of that year I was not teaching a lot. With that graph I can say, ""during peak times I was making X amount per month which translates into and annual salary of Y.""

Ok, back to work. These resumes are not going to send themselves. :)

Leigh Boone,Sharon Della,31/05/2013 21:03:02 UTC,RE: hi there,"Yeah. got tired of Derek. I guess the other truth though is I have a bad temper and I need to get in under control. It's stupid and it costs me. Though he is a pain in the ass, I need to learn to shut that shit down. 

I have been doing BD stuff since I started there. It was obvious from the start that a lot of what he does is last minute and half assed but he can usually pull it off, so yay him. And that's nothing new for CEOs. I myself have done it many times. 

The problem is when, each time, I think five projects now, there is either crucial (obvious) information to the project that he has missed (H-M) or neglects to give me (carnegie) or gives me last minute (carnegie, Sage, IMS) or that I point out information in the beginning, he blows it off, and then it comes back and we have to deal with it and changes after months of work (EiQ/UMT). I'm not saying I have all the answers or that I'm inflexible. I'm just saying this shit is preventable and the number one way for it to get fixed is for Derek to sit back and be a CEO and not the direct link to the client or acting product manager who only have five minutes to spend thinking about any of this. He needs to take himself out of the process or limit his exposure to them. And I know this whole Difference Engine thing is just getting started and that he is excited and we are short staffed, but he can't keep doing this. He is 10 conversations behind myself and the client and yet he wants to start every meeting by leading the direction instead of sitting back and hearing where things are. Even worse, while infront of the client he has reacted as if this is the first time he's seen our work and then precedes to throw us under the bus, I guess in order to save face, but while losing the loyalty of his employees...and it's not just me.

But the breaking point was to have him come to me to say I am not communicating (IMS and UMT/EiQ)...which is ironically hysterical, or that I can't take input (on everything). I can. I'm not hard to work with, but I am experienced at what I do and am going to advise on the best approach for the type of work I've done for 15 years. When I ask for clarity or details from him, the tools of my trade, the material I need to do my job, he shifts around and squirms...because he does not have the time to think these things through, and yet he continues to direct with authority. Which is what lead to my comment that he ""does not know what he is talking about."" Not as a CEO. I wouldn't know about that. I have not seen him work much as a CEO. I am speaking specifically of his role as a product manager and a direct link to the client and a micro-manager of how I do my job and as someone who doesn't have the type of time to dedicate to pulling these projects together.

After all, call me crazy, but the CEO of a company shouldn't be spending his time directing me on how to make a PNG with a script. As an Adobe Certified Instructor in Photoshop and three other products, I know how to make thumbnails with a fucking script. And yet, while I'm doing such a task, he is IMing my boss who is stretched thin and asking him to do the same work.

On top of it all Alli think the answer is for me to change how I do my job, how I and other creative workers have done their work for years, to something she learned at ""DeLoitte and Douchebag."" I told her as a creative, my job is to take all the pieces—pieces that Derek prevents me from getting (just Derek. I've worked with Alli, Jon Mott, Craig, Jeremy, and Brian and they give me the details I need)—and distill them down and work with them until I get the picture. Her advice is to, in order to work with Derek, I need to think first of the big picture and then do the details. That's great for business I guess, and that type of process sure as hell lead to an ass-backwards SOW for H-M recently that, between Alli and I working together, turned into a success. However, if I could turn the creative process upside down and start by giving some one the 3 minute anser to the unsolved riddle, I'd be fucking rich. 

At any rate, I'm really glad you emailed. I've been distracted with other things and it has been good to write down what the hell happened. I don't think—I know actually—Derek has no idea what happened. I know Alli understands some of this, but I think I'm going to share this info with her. Alli and I have rarely seen eye to eye, but then we have our moments of clarity and I am surprised. And it's not like they can fire me for saying it and, who knows, maybe some change will come of it.  The sad truth is that I honestly believe in that company. The people they have there are AWESOME. Really. And I think once they settle themselves it will be good, as long as Derek can stop stepping on his dick long enough to get out his talented staff's way. I don't wish him ill will. I just wish him clarity.

I would appreciate any leads you can send my way. I do have to be careful of the ed tech field though. Because I was doing so much BD, I am probably in danger of violating my NDA if I try to do anything in edTech. 

But not to worry. I'm good at this part. I've already had a lot of conversations this week and my door get's beaten down daily by recruiters. My rare combination of design, software instructor and developer makes me very marketable....and I know I am in a much better position than I left my coworkers in. I'm even taking some time off to get to some personal coding projects I have wanted to do for a few months now.

Well, that message certainly got long. I hope all is well with you. Keep in touch.

Yeah, I thought you'd say that. Chris and I were going to try and change things a bit, make it a company inside a company, but I had to bail. Sorry about that. There are other great companies in DC. Nothing says you have to stay at Omni. I only stayed a half day at the job I moved to DC for. And truth be told...do not repeat this, and delete this email...we made you an offer so quickly because we knew you would be snatched up if we didn't. Eileen didn't put you under some weird contract or anything did she? 

Here are some ideas if you want to look.

A guy who contracted for us now works across the street a t Oglvy. You might like him. His name is Amr (like the word arm but with a silent r). Amr Morsy <amrmorsy@me.com>

nclude is up the street from omni and they are really fantastic:

Fathom Creative is great and they run the DC Word Press meetup
http://www.fathomcreative.com/

Also, I have a pretty good recruiter if you want to talk to her. 

If you want to grab a beer next week and talk, let me know. I work in Chinatown but could meet you one day after work. Just give me a heads up because I have to metro in instead of taking the bus in if I stay late.

Leigh Boone,John Knight,19/10/2011 12:36:36 UTC,Grab Networks VP of Engineer position and thanks,"So hi again.

Things have been crazy at work and I was sitting at my desk updating my resume and thought, ""hmmm, maybe I'll ask John. He's the one that got me into this in the first place.""

First of all, thank you for getting me into this. Your love of technology was infectious and I really was paying attention all those drunk, smokey nights of endless chatter in dark bars. (was also fondly remembering where I saw my first ipod and how I told you I didn't get it...but you let me listen to it anyway) It's been a long road away from print design but I couldn't be happier (present situation excluded). I'm working now as a pseudo-UI developer/web designer (and Jill of all trades) and hope to head toward being an Information Architect one day (a friend and mentor just turned me on to the title a few days ago).

Just so you know how far I've come, you can see my handy work at www.grabnetworks.com. I built the whole thing using Django. As there is only me working on it, some things are still in draft form. One thing I'm pretty proud of is the Video Catalog tab on the footer. It still needs some work but I wrote about 85% of the code on my own.

Gratitude aside...things at Grab are a mess. They let their VP of engineering go, stopped looking for a replacement, and then replaced him with someone from the business and sales side with disastrous results. Now it's down to a handful of people. They're back to looking for a VP of E (I think when we were talking a few months ago it was a CTO but they've changed their mind ). Know anyone who's crazy enough to save a sinking ship? I ask because the business/sales leads have proven over and over again they can't hire an engineer if their company depended on it, and it does. And the Systems Architect, who is fantastic, is a master pacifist and won't fight them. I know I seem rather low on the totem pole to be asking this, but it's kind of a small company and I'm loud...which is rarely a good thing. 

Truth be told, I'm not sure this company is worth saving. I'm not sure they have the right formula to sustain their recent 'hokey stick' jump in revenue (aka the sales guys finally figured out how not to suck at their jobs and finally met their goal this quarter). But I kind of like my commute, and I don't think this is too hard to fix if there were someone in place who ""knew what the they were doing"" (their words, not mine), and someone who was crazy enough to fix a disaster.

Anyway, I gave it a shot. Back to working on my portfolio.

Hope all is well with you.

Best wishes.

My name is Amit. I work for AOL. (Yup! we’re the company that coined the phrase “You’ve got mail!” We’re still around. :-) You can actually check what we’ve been up to by going to visit http://corp.aol.com/ ) …So just curious, would you be open to perhaps having an exploratory discussion (via phone or e-mail) about career opportunities for yourself with our organization? Would love to discuss a Sr. Eng role with you. If you’re not ready to make a move now that’s totally fine but maybe we can start a dialogue so if in the future you’re ready to see what’s out there we’re both on each others radar. 

I look forward to your thoughts.
