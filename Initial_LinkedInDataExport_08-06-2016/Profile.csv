Leigh,Boone,Lawhon,17/04/2007 09:06:14 UTC,,3/1/1973,,Single,Front End UX/UI Developer and Designer at Booz Allen Hamilton,"I am a rare combination of Designer, Product Manager, and Developer with a passion for teaching and technology. With more than 15 year experience in tech, design, and education, I have a unique perspective for product development and design: I am a natural Information Architect and User Experience designer, with a talent for discovering all the available pieces of a project and working both bottom-up and the top-down to distill the products inherent system; I not only have the skills to successfully implement designs, but also the background to make experienced design decisions and recommend best practices along the way; and, as an instructor I have a passion for not only continuing my own education, but the skills to mentor and deliver training to my co-workers.

As an employee you will find that I am an advocate for my clients, often going beyond getting them a solution to getting them the right solution. I am also an advocate for my company and coworkers, constantly scouting for educational resources, creating new business channels, looking for ways to improve processes, and finding opportunities for networking.",Internet,
